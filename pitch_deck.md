# Pitch Deck: Verifiable AI Marketplace
### — Delivering Trust to the Intelligence Age —

**Tagline**: "Without verifiable data availability, AI cannot be trustless. Built on 0G."

---

## Slide 1: The Problem
### The Decentralized AI Gap
*   **Centralization**: AI models today are black boxes managed by a few giants.
*   **Non-Verifiable**: There is no proof that an AI output wasn't tampered with.
*   **Ephemeral**: Inferences disappear after the chat session—no permanent audit trail.
*   **Web3 Risk**: Smart contracts cannot safely rely on AI if the data availability isn't guaranteed.

## Slide 2: Our Solution
### The Verifiable AI Layer
We provide the missing trust layer between AI and Blockchain:
1.  **Cryptographic Commitments**: On-chain hashes of every prompt and result.
2.  **Permanent Data Availability**: Full inference traces stored on **0G Storage**.
3.  **End-to-End Privacy**: ECIES encryption keeps user prompts secure.
4.  **Network Audit Feed**: A transparent feed of every inference ever made.

## Slide 3: Tech Stack (Powered by 0G)
*   **0G Storage**: Our backbone for permanent Data Availability (DA).
*   **0G Galileo Testnet**: High-performance EVM layer for hash registration.
*   **Groq API**: Lightning-fast inference via authorized workers.
*   **TypeScript SDK**: Seamless integration with 0G Storage nodes.

---

## Slide 4: The User Flow
1.  **Request**: User pays 0.001 A0GI. Prompt is encrypted and hashed.
2.  **Inference**: Authorized worker detects the event, decrypts the prompt, and runs the model.
3.  **DA Upload**: Worker packages the trace and uploads to 0G Storage.
4.  **Verification**: Root Hash is written back to the contract. Anyone can click "Verify" to download and audit.

## Slide 5: Why 0G?
> "0G isn't just a database; it's the anchor for verifiable intelligence."

*   **Speed**: Enables sub-second retrieval of inference traces.
*   **Cost**: Drastically cheaper than storing full text on-chain.
*   **Native AI**: Built for the high-throughput needs of decentralized AI models.

---

## Slide 6: Future Roadmap
*   **zkML Integration**: Transitioning from hash-based proofs to Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning proofs.
*   **0G Compute**: Migrating the off-chain worker to reside natively on 0G compute nodes.
*   **Marketplace Economy**: Dynamic pricing based on model complexity and proof type.

## Slide 7: The Team & Vision
We are building the infrastructure for a world where AI is **open, verifiable, and permanent**.

**Built on 0G Zero Gravity.**
